# Time Estimation

## Pre-Development Estimates

| Task | Estimated Time | Priority |
|------|---------------|----------|
| Project setup & architecture design | 1.5 hours | High |
| Event system & streaming infrastructure | 2 hours | High |
| Base agent implementation | 1.5 hours | High |
| Security agent with tools | 2.5 hours | High |
| Bug detection agent with tools | 2.5 hours | High |
| Coordinator agent & orchestration | 2.5 hours | High |
| Streaming UI (WebSocket + frontend) | 2.5 hours | High |
| Testing & evaluation script | 1 hour | Medium |
| Documentation | 1 hour | Medium |
| **Total Estimated** | **17 hours** | |

## Post-Development Actuals

| Task | Actual Time | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Project setup & architecture design | 1.5 hours | Clean separation helped |
| Event system & streaming infrastructure | 2 hours | EventBus with pub/sub worked well |
| Base agent implementation | 1.5 hours | As estimated |
| Security agent with tools |  3.5 hours | Added more vulnerability patterns |
| Bug detection agent with tools | 2.5 hours  | As estimated |
| Coordinator agent & orchestration |  |  |
| Streaming UI (WebSocket + frontend) |  |  |
| Testing & evaluation script |  |  |
| Documentation |  |  |
| **Total Actual** |  | |
