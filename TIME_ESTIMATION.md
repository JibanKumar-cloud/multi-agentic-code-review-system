# Time Estimation

## Pre-Development Estimates

| Task | Estimated Time | Priority |
|------|---------------|----------|
| Project setup & architecture design | 2 hours | High |
| Event system & streaming infrastructure | 3 hours | High |
| Base agent implementation | 2 hours | High |
| Security agent with tools | 3 hours | High |
| Bug detection agent with tools | 3 hours | High |
| Coordinator agent & orchestration | 3 hours | High |
| Streaming UI (WebSocket + frontend) | 4 hours | High |
| Testing & evaluation script | 2 hours | Medium |
| Documentation | 1 hour | Medium |
