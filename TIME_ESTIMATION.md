# Time Estimation

## Instructions

Complete this document in three phases:

1. **Before coding:** Fill out Section 1 with your estimates
2. **During coding:** Log actual time in Section 2
3. **After coding:** Complete Section 3 with analysis

**Important:** Submit your initial estimates BEFORE starting development. We evaluate estimation accuracy as part of the assessment.
