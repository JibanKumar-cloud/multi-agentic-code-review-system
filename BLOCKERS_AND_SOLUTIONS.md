# Blockers & Solutions Log

## Instructions

Document challenges encountered during development and how you resolved them. This helps us understand your problem-solving approach and debugging skills.

**When to update this document:**
- When you hit a significant blocker (>30 min stuck)
- After solving a challenging problem
- When you make important architectural decisions
